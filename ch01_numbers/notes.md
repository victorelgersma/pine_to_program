## Numbers

### Integers and Floats

integers look like 5, -205, 99999, 0 etc
floats look like 54.321, 0.001 etc 

### Simple Arithmetic

- arithmetic with integers always yields integers 

```ruby
puts 9/2 # 4
```
if we want float division we want to make one of the operands a float:

```ruby
puts 9/ 2.0 #4.5
```

Note the difference in python:

```python3
9/2 # 4.5
9//2 # 4
```

So in ruby, the `/` is **overloaded** depending on the type of its operands.
